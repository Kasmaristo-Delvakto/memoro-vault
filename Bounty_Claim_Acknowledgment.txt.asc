Memoro Vault Security Response – v1.0.4 Bounty Claim Acknowledgment
- -------------------------------------------------------------------

I hereby confirm that the 10 XMR bounty for breaking Memoro Vault version 1.0.4 has been successfully and validly claimed by the independent security researcher known as "Desktop_Monitor."

The researcher identified cryptographic design flaws that compromise the current security model and allow the recovery of protected data under certain conditions. I express my sincere gratitude for their responsible disclosure, their professionalism in withholding exploit details to prevent harm, and their integrity in verifying the existence of the bounty before acting.

This disclosure fulfills the intent of the Memoro Vault bounty program: to surface vulnerabilities through open scrutiny, enabling future improvements.

As the anonymous author of Memoro Vault, I now face a critical decision: to either discontinue the project in order to preserve my anonymity, or to allow public disclosure of the identified flaws and continue development under renewed scrutiny.

Although I prefer to remain pseudonymous, I believe the core concept of Memoro Vault remains valid and important. The vision was never about me personally. It was about creating a secure, serverless, tamper-resistant vault for preserving digital assets and knowledge in a decentralized way — something the current ecosystem still lacks.

Therefore, I formally authorize Desktop_Monitor to publicly publish their findings on or after:

**July 2, 2025**

This will allow existing users to evaluate their exposure and migrate their data accordingly. The project may continue under this acknowledgment or evolve under community guidance, with lessons learned from this event.

Signed,
