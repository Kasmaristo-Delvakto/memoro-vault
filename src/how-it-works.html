  <h1>How Memoro Vault Works</h1>

  <h2>TL;DR</h2>
  <p>
    Memoro Vault is an offline, self-contained encryption tool that protects digital assets such as wallet keys, personal messages, and sensitive files. 
    Instead of passwords or logins, it uses memory-based questions chosen by you. 
    Unlocking requires not only the correct answers but also the correct sequence, with the option of adding misleading questions to confuse attackers. 
    Files are encrypted with industry-standard AES-256 and can be backed up physically using scannable QR codes. 
    Without your knowledge of the answers in the right order, the vault cannot be decrypted by anyoneâ€”not even its creators.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Memoro Vault Is Necessary</h2>
  <p>
    In the digital age, personal and financial data are fragile. They are stored on devices that fail, entrusted to companies that can shut down, or kept in cloud services that may be compromised. 
    Even legal systems cannot guarantee long-term accessibility for heirs or collaborators. 
    Memoro Vault addresses this challenge by creating a durable, self-sovereign container for valuable information that survives beyond individual accounts, jurisdictions, or corporate failures.
  </p>

  <h2>How the Encryption Works</h2>
  <p>
    When you build a vault, you create between nine and twenty-five personal questions. 
    These may be obscure facts, family memories, or shared knowledge among trusted individuals. 
    The answers themselves are never stored. 
    Instead, they are processed through Argon2id, a memory-hard key derivation function specifically designed to resist brute-force attempts, even from attackers with specialized hardware. 
    This process ensures that only someone with the correct knowledge can reconstruct the encryption key.
  </p>

  <h2>Red Herrings and Required Order</h2>
  <p>
    To further strengthen security, the system allows the inclusion of a red herring question. 
    A red herring looks plausible but is intentionally misleading, ensuring that attackers cannot succeed by guessing likely answers. 
    Additionally, Memoro Vault requires that answers be entered in the exact original sequence. 
    This sequence is enforced by a six-answer permutation model that introduces seven hundred and twenty possible arrangements, dramatically increasing complexity for unauthorized attempts.
  </p>

  <h2>File and Vault Integrity</h2>
  <p>
    Every file inside the vault, along with its name, metadata, and any final messages, is encrypted using AES-256 in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM). 
    This method provides both confidentiality and authenticity, meaning that no one can read or alter the data without detection. 
    The encrypted content is packaged into a portable, tamper-evident ZIP archive. 
    If the archive is modified in any way, recovery becomes impossible, thereby guaranteeing the integrity of what was originally sealed.
  </p>

  <h2>Physical Backups Using QR Codes</h2>
  <p>
    Memoro Vault also supports the generation of physical paper backups. 
    These backups divide the encrypted vault into QR-encoded tiles that can be printed and stored in a secure location or distributed among trusted individuals. 
    Even if all digital copies are lost, the vault can be reconstructed entirely from these printed pages, requiring no USB drives or online storage. 
    This feature ensures resilience against hardware failure or digital decay.
  </p>

  <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
  <p>
    Memoro Vault can safeguard cryptocurrency seed phrases, personal letters, creative works, or legal instructions. 
    It can preserve family history for future generations, enable trusted recovery without sharing accounts, and provide resistance against theft or coercion by incorporating misleading questions and strict permutations. 
    Above all, it empowers individuals to maintain absolute control over their digital legacy.
  </p>

  <p><strong>There are no backdoors and no exceptions.</strong> 
  Decryption is mathematically impossible without the exact answers in the correct order and the original vault file. 
  Memoro Vault does not rely on any external server or authority, making it an enduring safeguard for digital sovereignty.</p>
