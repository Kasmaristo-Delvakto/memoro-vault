<h1>Setup Your Security Questions</h1>
<p class="instruction">
  You can use the default questions or edit them.<br>
  Select exactly <b>two</b> questions to act as your first line of defense.

    <h2>How Unlocking Works</h2>
<p style="text-align: left; color: #ccc; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.6;">
  Memoro Vault uses a two-layer unlock system to balance convenience, encryption, and long-term security.<br><br>

  <b>Layer 1 — Interface Defense:</b><br>
  You select exactly two questions here. These are <i>not encrypted</i>, but they are protected by an exponential lockout timer. No hints are provided. If you know, you know.<br>
  This layer is designed to stop casual snooping and ensure the rest of the vault remains hidden behind strong encryption.<br><br>

  <b>Layer 2 — Full Encryption:</b><br>
  All remaining answers, files, and vault data are encrypted using AES-GCM. To access your vault, you must enter <i>every remaining answer exactly</i>.<br>
  During vault creation, <b>six answers</b> are secretly selected and their order is <b>randomized using cryptographic entropy</b>. This randomized order is securely embedded in the vault, and <i>not even the creator knows which six are affected</i>.<br><br>
  To decrypt the vault, you must still answer <b>all</b> questions correctly — but six of them must also be entered in the precise hidden order. In a 25-question vault, this introduces <b>720 possible permutations</b> (6!), and there's no indication which answers are out of order if you fail.<br><br>
  <i>Don’t worry — Memoro Vault handles the permutations for you automatically during recovery.</i> This design makes brute-force attacks (e.g. with tools like Hashcat) exponentially harder, without adding complexity for legitimate users.
