How Memoro Vault Works

Memoro Vault offers a novel, memory-based approach to cryptographic key storage—eliminating the vulnerabilities of physical backups and enabling a more resilient, decentralized form of digital inheritance.

Rethinking Traditional Seed Storage

Conventional storage solutions—paper, metal backups, hardware wallets—all suffer from a critical flaw: physical exposure. If your seed phrase is found, it can be compromised. Memoro Vault addresses this weakness by replacing static storage with encrypted, memory-based access—where the “key” is composed of answers only you (or your trusted network) would know.

Built for Decentralized Inheritance

Memoro Vault isn’t just a security tool—it’s also a self-sovereign estate planning mechanism. Users can structure their vaults so that no single individual knows all the answers required to unlock it, while multiple parties working together can recover it. This model enables secure legacy transfer without reliance on centralized custodians, attorneys, or third-party executors.

Preventing Loss Through Familiarity

Roughly 20% of all Bitcoin is estimated to be lost—primarily due to forgotten or misplaced seed phrases. Memoro Vault reduces this risk by anchoring recovery to biographical memory and relational knowledge, rather than static objects or fragile locations. Vault files themselves are designed to be unremarkable and unintelligible to outsiders—further reducing the risk of targeted attacks.

Dual-Layer Security Architecture

Layer 1 – Dashboard Access

Requires correct answers to two memory questions

Reveals only metadata (e.g., question types, dashboard layout)

Incorrect attempts trigger escalating lockout timers

Layer 2 – Full Recovery

Requires 16–25 memory answers (with character-length hints)

Includes a dynamic Proof-of-Work (PoW) system that increases in difficulty with each failed attempt

Full seed decryption only occurs when all inputs are correct

Cryptographic Design
AES-256 encryption using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations for both layers

SHA-256 for hashing and nonce-based PoW

All vault content remains fully encrypted until correct memory inputs and PoW are provided

No sensitive data is stored in plaintext—neither seeds nor hints

Security rests on the uniqueness of your memory inputs. Choose obscure, deeply personal answers not easily guessed or scraped.

Memoro Vault is designed to operate fully offline—eliminating the risks of clipboard scraping, internet-based exploits, or remote compromise. Once created, your encrypted vault file can be safely stored on USB drives, SD cards, or cloud services. Without the correct memory and a valid PoW solution, the file is cryptographically inaccessible.

Summary
Eliminates physical points of failure using memory-based encryption

Protects sensitive data through two independent layers of defense

Designed for long-term, decentralized inheritance

Requires no internet connection for use or recovery

Open-source and released under the GNU GPLv3 license

Memoro Vault is not merely a tool. It’s a new philosophy of self-custody—rooted in memory, resistant to surveillance, and ready for the world ahead.
