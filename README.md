# Memoro Vault

**Memoro Vault is a privacy-first memory vault designed to protect everyday people—not just the rich—from loss, theft, and institutional overreach.**  
It helps you store your most important digital secrets and documents—then locks access behind questions only you or your trusted circle can answer.

## Why It Matters for the Working Class

The wealthy use trusts, lawyers, and family offices to protect and pass on their assets.  
Everyone else is left with folders in drawers, unencrypted USB sticks, and vague instructions.

- 67% of Americans have no estate plan  
- Probate eats up 3–8% of what you leave behind  
- Identity theft hits hardest when documents are lost or exposed  
- Billions in crypto, logins, or digital assets are lost every year—often permanently

Memoro Vault changes that by giving everyday people a way to secure and share critical information—without relying on lawyers, subscriptions, or cloud-based services that can be hacked or shut down.

## Use Cases

Memoro Vault can be used to securely store and protect:

- **Seed phrases** for crypto wallets (without leaving them exposed)
- **Password lists** or master password files
- **Scanned birth certificates or SSNs**
- **Medical directives and living wills**
- **Banking or investment account instructions**
- **Private letters or ethical wills**
- **Emergency contacts or instructions for family**

Whether you’re trying to pass something down or protect yourself in life, Memoro Vault keeps your data locked—until the right people remember the right answers.

## Two Layers of Defense

### Layer 1 – Dashboard Access
- Requires correct answers to two personal memory questions
- Grants access only to vault structure and layout—not the content
- Incorrect attempts trigger escalating lockout delays to slow guessing

### Layer 2 – Full Recovery
- Requires 4–25 total answers (you define them)
- Enforces a dynamic Proof-of-Work (PoW) challenge that must be solved each time
- Only if all answers and the nonce are correct does final decryption occur

## How It Works

1. **Create your vault.**  
   Choose custom memory questions—things only you or a few people would know.

2. **Upload sensitive files.**  
   Passwords, birth certificates, social security scans, seed phrases—anything under 250MB.

3. **Encrypt offline.**  
   Everything is locked with AES-256 using a key derived from your answers and a mined nonce.

4. **Store safely.**  
   Keep the encrypted `.zip` file on a USB drive, in your will, or with someone you trust.

5. **Recover when needed.**  
   With the right answers and a new proof-of-work solution, the vault unlocks—anywhere, anytime.

## Privacy and Security

- **No internet required.** Everything is client-side. No cloud sync, no central server, no tracking.
- **No passwords to forget.** You define the questions. The answers are the keys.
- **No backdoors.** Vaults are AES-256 encrypted with 100,000 rounds of PBKDF2.
- **No readable data.** Even filenames and metadata are encrypted until unlocked.
- **No trust required.** It's open-source and GPLv3 licensed.

Memoro Vault is built for people who can’t afford to get this wrong.

## Flexible Access Options

- Keep all answers yourself, relying on memory
- Split questions between loved ones, requiring teamwork to unlock
- Add hints to aid recall while preventing brute-force attempts
- Leave instructions in your will that guide your heirs without revealing your secrets

## Why It’s Different

Memoro Vault isn’t just a crypto tool. It’s a blueprint for **self-sovereign inheritance** and **offline digital resilience**—without needing lawyers, apps, or subscriptions.

It replaces fragile storage with durable memory.  
It shifts power from institutions to individuals.  
It’s estate planning for people without a family office.
